All specified paths are relative to your browser save folder.
If you leave "save path" field empty, it will save files straight to it.
if you leave "filename" field empty, files will be saved with default filenames.
File extension will be set automatically, please don't specify it explicitly.
Using placeholders from the list below you can save files from each domain
in their own folders, or with some specific filenames.

List of available placeholders, must be surrounded with ::
::domain:: 			Domain name of the current site
::title::				Title of the current page
::board_code::		Board code if exists
::thread_number::		Thread number if exists
::datetime::			Current date and time
::date::				Current date
::time::				UNIX timestamp
::filename::			Default filename as assigned by browser
::original_filename::	Original filename, available on most popular imageboards
::both_filenames::		Same as empty field, filename depending on mouse button pressed

You can choose mouse button or keyboard hotkey or both for each template.

You can specify domain name if you want some hotkey/save template to work only on this specific site.
You can also exclude hotkey for specific site, so it will work everywhere except this specific site.
To do this add domain name starting with "-" symbol.
You can get domain name either from address bar, or you can open
Web Console (Ctrl+Shift+K) and write document.location.hostname, the result will be
domain name you should insert into "domain name" field.
Rules with "domain name" have higher priority than "-domain name" rules.
Rules without domain name specified have lowest priority.

Examples:
wikipedia.org : this hotkey will only work on wikipedia.org
-twitter.com : this hotkey will work everywhere except twitter.com
