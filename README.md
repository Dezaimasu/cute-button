# Cute Save Button

**Little button to save images and webms in one click. Praise cute!**

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cute-save-button/

* You can set your custom icon so the button would be even more cuter. Protip: it won't.
* Always downloads orginal full-sized images (currently supported: vk.com, twitter.com, tumblr.com)
* Click on the button to save the file
* Right click to save with original filename (currently supported: 4chan.org, 2ch.hk, iichan.hk, boards.fireden.net, yuki.la, exhentai.org)
* Middle click to save the file and copy its url to clipboard
* Space is the same as left click
* Ctrl+Space is the same as right click
* Alt+Q to hide the button
* Hold Shift for "deep scan" (checks for background-image and ignores filtering by image size)
* Hold Ctrl to delay button hiding for 1 second (can be useful if button somehow appeared outside of the image area)
