* You can set any amount of save locations accessible via customizable hotkeys. Make sure your hotkey won't interfere with browser reserved hotkeys.
* Click on the button or press Space to save the file to default location
* You can set your custom tiny icon so the button would be even more cuter. Protip: it won't.
* Can download orginal full-sized images (currently supported: vk, twitter, tumblr, instagram)
* Right click (or Ctrl+Space) to save with original filename (works on most popular imageboards)
* Middle click to save the file and copy its url to clipboard
* Alt+Q to hide the button
* Hold Shift for "deep scan" (checks for background-image and ignores filtering by image size)
* Hold Ctrl to prevent button from hiding (can be useful if button somehow appeared outside of the image area)
