# Cute Button

**Little button to save images and webms in one click. Praise cute!**

* Now you can set your custom icon so the button would be even more cuter. Protip: it won't.
* Click on the button to save the file
* Right click to save with original filename (currently supported sites: 4chan.org, 2ch.hk, iichan.hk, boards.fireden.net, yuki.la, exhentai.org)
* Space is the same as left click
* Ctrl+Space is the same as right click
* Alt+Q to hide the button
* Hold Shift to ignore filtering by image size
* Hold Ctrl to delay button hiding for 1 second (can be useful if button somehow appeared outside of the image area)
